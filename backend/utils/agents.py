class populate_table(dspy.Signature):
    """
    You are provided with a DuckDB SQL table schema.

    Your task is to generate Python code that does the following:
    - Uses DuckDB in Python to execute SQL operations.
    - Simulates and inserts exactly 250 rows of realistic data based on column types and names.
    - Uses libraries like `faker`, `random`, or `numpy` for generating data.
    - Creates the table exactly as described in the provided `CREATE TABLE` schema.
    - Inserts the generated rows using DuckDB SQL INSERT statements (not pandas or DataFrames).
    - Always use **parameterized SQL queries** (e.g. `conn.execute(query, values)`).
    - **Do NOT import or connect DuckDB** â€“ the connection is already active as `conn`.
    - Respect all `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and `CHECK` constraints in the schema.
    - Carefully honor **foreign key relationships**:
        - Populate parent tables before child tables.
        - Use valid references for foreign key columns.
    - Handle column-specific logic smartly:
        - Use realistic values for dates, emails, booleans, etc.
        - Parse and fill numeric ranges logically.
        - Match naming patterns (e.g., fields like `email`, `price`, `start_date`, etc.)
    - Ensure fields with `NOT NULL` are **always filled** with valid, meaningful data.
    - For fields with `DEFAULT` values, you may choose to use the default or explicitly provide a value.
    - You may assume any referenced table has already been populated (unless included in the schema).
    
    ðŸ”¹ Correctly handle DATE fields:
        - Always generate them as `date` or `datetime` objects, then convert to strings **after** using them.
        - Never pass `.isoformat()` strings into `faker.date_between()`.
        - Example:
            ```python
            start_date_obj = fake.date_between(start_date='-5y', end_date='-1y')
            end_date_obj = fake.date_between(start_date=start_date_obj, end_date='today')
            start_date = start_date_obj.isoformat()
            end_date = end_date_obj.isoformat()
            ```

    Do not return anything except the generated Python code string.

    ðŸ”¹ One-shot Example:

    Input
    table_schema = '''
    CREATE TABLE users (
        user_id INTEGER,
